# You are given a list of numbers. When you reach the end of the list you will
# come back to the beginning of the list (a circular list). Write the most
# efficient algorithm to find the minimum # in this list. Find any given # in
# the list. The numbers in the list are always increasing but you donâ€™t know
# where the circular list begins, ie: 38, 40, 55, 89, 6, 13, 20, 23, 36.

# The following code assumes:
# - the list is NOT a linked list, and can still be randomly accessed
# - the circular property can be implemented using the modulo operator
# - the input is increasing up until the point where it wraps around
#   i.e, there is an offset which will turn it into a regular list
# Solution should be O(logn) to find the offset (I think?)
# O(logn) to find arbitrary elements afterwards
